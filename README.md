## Database Schema

The database schema is defined using Odoo's ORM. The Component schema includes fields for name, category, configuration, customization, and price. The Build schema includes fields for user ID, components, configuration, customization, price, build history, recommendations, sharing, import/export, analytics, and support.

## Backend

The backend is developed using Python. It handles component selection, configuration, customization, pricing, build history, recommendations, sharing, import/export, analytics, support, visibility, comparison price, prevent sales of zero priced products, and new menu.

## Security

The module implements secure component selection and configuration. It protects against common web vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting. It also uses HTTPS for secure communication.

## Testing

The module is thoroughly tested to ensure it functions as expected. Testing includes unit testing, integration testing, end-to-end testing, performance testing, and security testing. It is also tested for compatibility across different browsers and devices.

## Documentation

The module is well-documented. This includes API documentation, user documentation, system architecture documentation, and security documentation. The documentation is written in a clear and concise manner, making it easy for developers to understand and contribute to the project.

## Access Rights

The module implements access rights. Access rights are defined as records of the model `ir.model.access`. Each access right is associated with a model, a group (or no group for global access), and a set of permissions: read, write, create, unlink. Such access rights are usually created by a CSV file named after its model.

## Conclusion

This module provides a clear roadmap for the development process and ensures that the final product meets the needs of the users.
