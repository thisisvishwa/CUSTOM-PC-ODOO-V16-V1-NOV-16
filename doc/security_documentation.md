# Security Documentation

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the security measures implemented in the Advanced Custom PC Building Module for Odoo V16 CE.

## Secure Component Selection and Configuration

The module implements secure component selection and configuration. This is achieved by validating user inputs and sanitizing them to prevent SQL injection attacks. The system also uses parameterized queries or prepared statements to ensure that user inputs are not executed as SQL commands.

## Protection Against Web Vulnerabilities

The system is designed to protect against common web vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS). This is achieved by validating and sanitizing user inputs, using parameterized queries or prepared statements, and encoding data that is output to the user.

## HTTPS for Secure Communication

The system uses HTTPS for secure communication. HTTPS encrypts the data sent between the user and the server, protecting it from eavesdropping, tampering, and message forgery.

## Access Rights

The module implements access rights using the `ir.model.access` model in Odoo. Each access right is associated with a model, a group (or no group for global access), and a set of permissions: read, write, create, unlink. Access rights are usually created by a CSV file named after its model.

## Conclusion

Security is a critical aspect of the Advanced Custom PC Building Module. By implementing secure component selection and configuration, protecting against common web vulnerabilities, using HTTPS for secure communication, and implementing access rights, the system ensures that user data is protected and that the system is secure from common threats.
